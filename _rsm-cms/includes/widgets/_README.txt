CUSTOM WIDGETS:

You can create custom fields for widgets using ACF Pro, however, the custom fields won't be usable in page builders, which is part of the big draw to use something like that.

If you want to just create a widget that is useable within the standard WordPress widget area, do this:

1) Create a field group in ACF for your widget and assign the "Location" to "Widget" and then select the your custom widget (step 2)

2) Copy the example "widget-rsm-entry-point.php". You only need to update the name of the widget and the custom front-end markup that you want rendered. EASY!
